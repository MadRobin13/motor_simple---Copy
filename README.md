# FRC Intake and shooter test code

### Uncomment code to use for intake vs shooter

**Motor top and bottom are for the shooter (order should be self explanatory)**

**The other 3 motors are for the intake where the smark maxes have their ids taped onto them so it should be fine for those.**

**Modify the decimals to change the speed (0 - 1 = 0% - 100%).**

**Reach out to me for any questions.**
